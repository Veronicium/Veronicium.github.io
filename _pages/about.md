I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the Language Technologies Institute of Carnegie Mellon University and I am working with [Prof. Carolyn Ros√©](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose){:target="\_blank"} and [Prof. Daniel Fried](https://dpfried.github.io){:target="\_blank"}. Previously, I obtained my Master degree in the data mining group at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign supervised by [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu){:target="\_blank"} and obtained my Bachelor degree in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I received the Academic Achievement Medal.

My research goal is to build generalizable, scalable and data efficient systems to reduce human labor. This includes:

* **NLP for code & Code for NLP**:
  * Code generation systems: CMTrans
  * Code generation evaluation: CodeBenchGen
  * Code for other tasks

* **Reduce human supervision in learning and evaluation**:
  * Data efficient learning: training with silver labels (CMTrans, Eider), transfer learning (Anchor-DR, KoMen), model-generated signals (Eider, METRO-T0)
  * Scalable evaluation: DocLens, CodeBenchGen
