I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the Language Technologies Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. Before entering CMU, I obtained my Master degree in the data mining group at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign supervised by Prof. Jiawei Han. 

I have broad interest in NLP and data mining. My previous/ongoing research topics include pretrained language models, information extraction, summarization, taxonomy construction and graph algorithms. I currently work on improving the pre-training of text-to-text language models to obtain better sequence embeddings. This can be applied to downstream tasks such as dense retrieval and recommendation.

Previously, I completed the Bachelor study in computer science and mathematics in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I received the Academic Achievement Medal.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
