I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the Language Technologies Institute of Carnegie Mellon University and I am working with [Prof. Carolyn Ros√©](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose){:target="\_blank"} and [Prof. Daniel Fried](https://dpfried.github.io){:target="\_blank"}. Previously, I obtained my Master degree in the data mining group at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign supervised by [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu){:target="\_blank"} and obtained my Bachelor degree in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I received the Academic Achievement Medal.

My research goal is to build generalizable, scalable and data efficient systems to reduce human labor. This includes:

* **NLP for Code & Code for NLP**:
  * Code generation systems: [CMTrans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00317)
  * Code generation evaluation: [CodeBenchGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00566)
  * Code generation to assist other tasks


* **Learning and Evaluation with Light Human Effort**:
  * Data efficient learning: 
    * training with silver labels ([CMTrans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00317), [Eider](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08657))
    * transfer learning ([Anchor-DR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05834), [KoMen](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/files/komen.pdf))
    * model-generated signals ([Eider](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08657), [METRO-T0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12567))
  * Scalable evaluation: [DocLens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09581), [CodeBenchGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00566)
